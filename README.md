# Terrain_Generator
A real time generator of terrain-like 3D-texture.
When running, the animation also could be used as a simple flight simulator.
This is implemented using a simple 2D grid which is rotated over the z-axis, while generating random valleys which follow a basic coloring scheme according to the valley's height.

Includes 2 coloring schemes - default includes snow, grass & see, second mode includes flying over seas.
